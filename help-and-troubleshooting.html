                <h2>Steps to solve errors in video to GIF conversion:</h2>
                <li><h3>Reload the page and try again.</h3></li>
                <p>Sometimes Chrome extensions, browser preferences, and other client-side issues can disrupt our conversion process.</p>
                <li><h3>Try again in an incognito/private browsing window.</h3></li>
                <p>This can help fix issues related to extensions, cookies, or preferences.</p>
                <li><h3>Try changing the frame rate settings.</h3></li>
                <p>Sometimes a different frame rate setting can solve errors in the conversion process, especially those that are related to CPU or memory usage.</p>
                <li><h3>Try changing the quality settings.</h3></li>
                <p>Similar to the frame rate settings, changing the quality settings can sometimes solve errors in the conversion process.</p>
                <li><h3>Try a different video format.</h3></li>
                <p>This tool has only been tested with .mov and .mp4 files. While other video formats (.wmv, etc) may work, they have been known to have more issues.</p>
                <li><h3>Try a smaller video.</h3></li>
                <p>Sometimes our script will throw errors when videos have excessively large or poorly defined dimensions, as identifying the video's size is crucial to our conversion process. Additionally, while we do not impose limits on file size, it's possible that very large files (over 1 GB) will throw errors, either due to the limitations of your device or because the script took excessively long to run.</p>

                        Steps to solve slow video to GIF conversion:
                    </h2>
                    <li><h3>Try changing the frame rate settings.</h3></li>
                    <p>A lower frame rate setting means the converter needs to capture and create fewer frames, which means a faster conversion. However, the video may appear choppier.</p>
                    <li><h3>Try changing the quality settings.</h3></li>
                    <p>Similar to the frame rate settings, changing the quality settings usually drastically speeds up the conversion process. In situations where a fast conversion is preferred over a high resolution output, Low and Lowest Quality settings are optimal (in some cases, Low Quality is up to 4 times faster than High Quality).</p>

                                <li><h3>A robots.txt file provides information to search engines (like Google and Bing) about what pages of your website they should and should not index</h3></li>
                                <p>This can be helpful for complicated sites and webapps that have many pages that are not necessary for Google to display on their search results. It is possible that providing this information via a robots.txt file may improve your website's performance in search results, as Google will be able to index only important pages and not penalize you for pages not meant to be seen by most users or search engines.</p>
                                <p>However, SEO and search engine crawlers are extremely complex topics. It is also possible that this will have no positive effect at all on your website. However, Google and other major search engines now consider them to be best practices in modern web development.</p>
